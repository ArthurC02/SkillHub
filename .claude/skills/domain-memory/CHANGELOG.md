# Changelog

Notable changes to the Domain Memory plugin, newest first. The format follows Keep a Changelog, and versions follow Semantic Versioning: a minor version adds or changes behavior, a patch version only fixes it. Versions before 0.10.0 are recorded in the repository history only.

## 0.10.1

### Fixed

- A file-system error, such as `init-change-package --output` naming a file, ends in one `ERROR:` line and exit code 1 instead of a Python traceback.
- `verify-audit` reports `invalid` for a `--registry-root` that holds no Registry, instead of calling an absent audit chain valid.

## 0.10.0

### Changed

- When another proposal's apply changes the Registry, `verify-proposal`, `finalize-proposal` and `apply-approved-updates` rebuild the base Registry from the proposal's observed commit and accept it if the records it touches are unchanged; otherwise it is still stale, and the refusal names what changed. Commit the Registry before `submit-proposal` to benefit.
- `record-test-result` runs its command without a shell, split by POSIX quoting rules on every platform. Pipes, `&&` and `VAR=value` prefixes are no longer available.

### Fixed

- `record-test-result` ran from the command line, and accepts any profile when the policy approves none.
